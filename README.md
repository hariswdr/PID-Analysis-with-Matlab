# PID-PD-PI-Analysis-with-Matlab
This system has Loop Gain (L(s)) = G(s)*H(s) = 𝐾/((𝑠+1)(𝑠+2)(𝑠+10))
with:
Settling Time (Ts)       = 1 s
Overshoot (OS)           = 10%
Error Steady State (Ess) = 0

You can modify the system specification by recalculate and make some changes on Matlab source code.
Thank you, have fun!
